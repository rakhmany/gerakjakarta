- **2D Flipbook** - "Old but Gold: 2D Flipbook" Experience the classic charm of traditional flipbooks with our 2D flipbook, crafted using CSS and HTML5 tags. This interactive and flippable digital flipbook remains a valuable alternative to its 3D counterpart.When speed is crucial and 3D effects are not a priority, such as on low-end devices, the 2D flipbook offers a faster loading time and a smooth browsing experience. Embrace nostalgia and enjoy the timeless appeal of 2D flipbooks, where the simplicity of design meets the beauty of interactivity.
- **PDF embed and PDF Viewer** - For those who prefer classic PDF viewers, Dear Flipbook offers a feature that allows you to create PDF embeds on your page that mimic the look and feel of a browser's embedded PDF viewer. This option is particularly suitable for documents with irregular layouts or formatting.
- **PDF Slider like SlideShare** - Why leave the basic slider, when complex flipbook are already available. Flipbook offers a simple and intuitive slider mode that allows users to view PDF pages as slides. This feature is especially useful for documents with unconventional layouts or formatting, making it easier to navigate and present the content effectively.



### File Formats Supported by Dear Flipbook
- **PDF / PDF Flipbook** – Why do we recommend using 3D PDF Flipbooks? The key lies in their incredible simplicity. These PDF flipbooks are incredibly easy to create and use. Built on the powerful PDF.js library, they offer exceptional convenience, making management and updates a breeze. All it takes is a simple link to the PDF file, eliminating any unnecessary hassle. As our recommended file format for 3D flipbooks, we guarantee an unparalleled user experience.
- **Image / Image Flipbook** – If you have a collection of images that you want to display, why not create a captivating storybook out of them using ALBUMS? Picture Flipbook serves as your virtual album, enabling you to flip through, share, and cherish your photographs and portfolios with the world.


### Customer Engagement and Presentation ###
**Presentation Matters!**  At the core of an online flipbook lies the fundamental principle of customer engagement. Traditional document layouts fall short when it comes to captivating audiences. Scrolling through a PDF to consume content is not ideal, especially when the focus is more on presentation rather than mere information. Whether you're promoting an idea, product, artwork, or portfolio, showcasing it visually is far more impactful than simply listing it. It's no coincidence that websites are not solely text-based; their vibrant colors and interactive elements are designed specifically to foster CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT.

If these installation FAQs don't solve your query and issues, please contact using the official WordPress support page.


= How to install the Dear Flipbook flipbook WordPress plugin? =


1. Goto **'Plugins > Add New'** inside WordPress admin
2. Search for **'dflip'** in the search plugins text box

= Loading Case 1: No Loading Icon + Long Message: =
dFlip 3D Flipbook WordPress Usage & FAQs 1
If you see the loading message and don’t see a loading icon. Then the issue is related to code execution.


1. Cause A – Other plugin error: Dear Flipbook uses jQuery to start the plugin and if other jQuery plugins cause any errors, the execution of Dear Flipbook is also disturbed. The flipbook never advances further and is stuck at the initial loading message. Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors.
2. Cause B – WordPress 5.5 update: This is similar to cause A. With WordPress 5.5, jQuery got updated and many other plugins failed, and that results in cause A. So check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors.
3. Cause C – Dear Flipbook error: Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors. If the error displayed is from dflip.min.js then report it using the contact lite support button below.




= Loading Case 2: Loading Icon + Loading Message: =
This is a normal case and the messages are displayed as the resources and files are loaded.


= Loading Case 3: Loading stuck at certain Message: =
This happens when the related file for loading is missing or inaccessible. For the best results, we recommend using(hosting) the files from the same domain. Check your Browser console (CTRL + SHIFT + I) and make sure there are no errors. If there are errors please report it using the contact lite support button below.


= Loading Case 4: Cannot access File: =
Make sure the file is accessible. Try opening the link in the browser, opening a new tab and inserting the PDF URL – see if it opens. Make sure it opens.


1. Cause A – File is not available: Filename is mistaken or not added at all.
2. Cause B – CORS Issue: This happens a lot when users don’t understand what file access means in the modern web. PDF files are not accessible from one domain to another just like that. They require permission. You need to set proper CORS permission into the domain where the PDF files exist, so that your domain can access it. NOTE: PDF files from online file-sharing servers like Google Drive, One Drive, Dropbox cannot be configured for CORS access. They won’t allow it.




== Frequently Asked Questions ==


= How to install Dear Flipbook in my WordPress site? =


Please check the installation tab for details.




= How many pages can 3D Flipbook support and how big can a PDF file be? =


Dear Flipbook - 3D Flipbook uses PDF.js to render the PDF pages. At any given time it requires only 6 pages of data at max. So the amount of pages in a PDF file doesn't really affect the 3D Flipbook. Also, it only loads 6 Pages of data to start the flipbook and this makes it a resource friendly and traffic friendly 3D flipbook. Other 3D flipbooks might crash with huge files, Dear Flipbook will last longer.
> [Trom Site](https://www.tromsite.com/) is one of our premium client and one of their book has **1144 Pages and is 532MB** in size. It loads with only 4-5MB of PDF data.




= How to create a PDF flipbook in a WordPress Page? =


1. Upload a pdf file to your WordPress site.
2. Inside the Edit page/post, add the following shortcode
[dflip source="Path\To\PdfFile.pdf"]
For more details visit the [Online Documentation](https://dearflip.com/go/wp-lite-docs)




= Creating a PDF Flipbook WordPress Post with PDF =
1. Goto **'dFlip Books > Add New Book'**
2. Enter the title of the PDF flipbook in Title box
3. Click on **'Select PDF'** button and select a PDF that you want to use for creating your 3D PDF Flipbook
4. Upload the PDF file if you have not uploaded already and select the PDF file
4. CLick on **'Publish'** button and the page should save and reload




= Creating a 3D Flipbook WordPress Post with Images =


1. Goto **'dFlip Books > Add New Book'**
2. Enter the title of the 3D Flipbook in Title box
3. In 'Book Source Type' select 'Images' to create a WordPress Flipbook from images
4. Click on **'Add new Page'** button and select the images you want to use for creating your 3D Flipbook WordPress post
5. Arrange the order of images by dragging the images left or right
4. Click on **'Publish'** button and the page should save and reload


= Adding Flipbook to a WordPress Page =


1. From the 3D Flipbook you just created, copy the shortcode from **'Shortcode'** box. Similar to [dflip id="525"][/dflip]
2. Goto the page where you want to insert the flipbook and paste the shortcode




= Creating a PDF Flipbook with just PDF File URL =


You can create a flipbook with just the link and without creating the dFlip post
1. Goto the page where you want to create a flipbook from pdf
2. Use a shortcode to embed the flipbook: **[dflip source="example.com/wp-content/uploads/file.pdf"]**
**source** is the link to the PDF file that you want to convert to Flipbook




= PDF links are not working! =


1. PDF links are a premium feature in Dear Flipbook, and won't be displayed in lite version of Dear Flipbook - 3D Flipbook WordPress Plugin. You can test your PDF links to check how they work in our online [PDF Flipbook Viewer](https://dearflip.com/go/wp-lite-pdf-viewer).
2. Also pay attention that some desktop readers' auto convert URL texts to links and give an assumption that those are links. Such links won't work in every reader and device. One of the popular cases is Adobe PDF Reader: it auto-converts the text URLs to links in desktop but not in mobile apps. So we suggest defining links explicitly and not rely on PDF reader's auto conversion capability.


= Start or open a 3D Flipbook at a certain page? =


You can set the opening page of a flipbook with shortcode:
**<code>[dflip id="123" data-page=5]</code>**
This will create your PDF flipbook or image flipbook to open at page 5 when it starts.

= What is better? PDF embed or lightbox PDF viewer? =


We recommend to use lightbox for PDF viewer instead of PDF embed viewer. Using embed can result in extra bandwidth for the PDF documents even if the user maynot view the document.
